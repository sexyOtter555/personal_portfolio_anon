          <h4>Introduction</h4>
          <p>
            This project focuses on redesigning the website for Providence Tattoo, a local
            tattoo store in Providence, Rhode Island. When visiting
            <a href="https://providencetattoo.com/home.html">their website</a>, some of the parts are
            functional and they do provide correct information of their contact and address. However, the site
            looks dated and suffers from a number of usability issues. As such, in my redesign,
            I focus on making the site <b>more user friendly</b>, making elements
            <b>more intuitive</b>, and simplifying the structure so that information is
            more readable and <b>more logically grouped</b>.
          </p>
          <h4>Analysis</h4>
          <p>
            I first began by more closely analyzing the details of the webpage, focusing
            on the usability and accessibility concepts that we discussed in class. My
            main points are described in more detail below:
          </p>
      
          <b>Effectiveness:</b>
          <ul>
            <li>
              hinders users in completing the following actions: 
              <ul>
              <li>following on social media since the buttons are too small and barely legible; </li>
              <li>looking for previous design examples, since there is no section for a gallery; </li>
             <li>navigating through the web page and making reservation; looking for most relevant information like contact and address</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            
          </ul>
          <b>Learnability:</b>
          <ul>
            <li>(1) font sizes don't really follow specific logic</li>
            <li>
              (2) the colors of the buttons seem random and don’t have special meaning
              (green, white, red [may have unintended connotations towards the Italian
              flag], and blue on hover)
            </li>
            <li>
              (3) large section with no obvious and significant meaning (“the art of tea”)
            </li>
            <li>
              (4) gallery on first glance isn’t intuitive about switching images (no
              buttons or arrows)
              <ul>
                <li>
                  hardly any obvious color contrast between currently active image and
                  other images
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              (5) “order now” is bolded, which can misleadingly suggest a clickable link
            </li>
          </ul>
          <b>Memorability:</b>
          <ul>
            <li>
              (1) tons of menu options makes it overwhelming and cluttered; users must
              read through all the options in order to navigate the site
            </li>
            <li>
              grouping and hierarchy doesn’t really make sense in a few places, which
              makes it difficult to remember the site's layout
              <ul>
                <li>
                  (6) map icon links to one specific location that doesn’t match the main
                  address on the webpage and is grouped with the other social media icons
                </li>
                <li>
                  (6) two contact options are listed on the left, which overlaps with the
                  social media links on the bottom
                </li>
                <li>
                  (7) commendations and awards are on opposite ends of the page (one on
                  the top and one on the bottom)
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            In terms of <b>accessibility</b>, there weren't any glaring visual concerns
            except for the low contrast created by the black text on a red background.
            With the WebAIM WAVE tool, I noticed that although the website's alt tags were
            not descriptive (ex: “Resized 4 OTS.jpg” for their logo). Furthermore, when
            using the screen reader, I found that there were 5 different elements to go
            through before reaching their main navigation and in the navigation bar,
            between “menu” and “pick and brew tea”, there were 9 sub elements of “menu”
            that we had to navigate through. As such, in my redesign, I want to prioritize
            being able to better navigate through the main navigation bar and making
            descriptions more clear.
          </p>
          <h4>Lo-fi Wireframes</h4>
          <p>
            Based on the usability problems identified in the previous section, I first
            created some mockups for my redesign while trying to keep as many of the
            original elements as possible. In these wireframes of 3 different devices
            (desktop, tablet, and phone), I’ve annotated the sections that have been
            re-designed with the numbers associated with their identified problems and
            described them in further detail below.
          </p>
          <div class="img-container">
            <img src="assets/redesign/lowfi3.png" width="90%" class="img-thumbnail" />
          </div>
          <br />
          <div class="img-container">
            <img src="assets/redesign/lowfi1.png" width="60%" class="img-thumbnail" />
            <img src="assets/redesign/lowfi2.png" width="70%" class="img-thumbnail" />
          </div>
          <br />
          <ol>
            <li>
              To increase efficiency and usability, I moved the site’s navigation bar to
              the top. This creates a
              <b>more consistent theme</b> for the rest of the pages in the website. This
              mockup also keeps the navigation bar fixed at the top, making it
              <b>easy to access</b> while browsing. Some of the sections were cut down or
              renamed, making the point of each section <b>more clear</b> and increasing
              readability. In the mobile version, the menu is collapsed into a clickable
              button to prevent clutter and increase space efficiency.
            </li>
            <li>
              Combined the different colored buttons into a single “Order Online” button
              in the upper right, which makes the interface <b>more standard</b> and
              <b>more learnable</b>. Moving the order button here should also
              <b>increase visual contrast</b> and draw attention without using distracting
              colors. In the mobile version, this feature is inside the menu.
            </li>
            <li>
              This sectionw as combined with the “new drink” image to create a gallery.
              This creates a <b>more centralized</b> spot for announcements and banner
              advertisements. It’ll also allow the website to stay
              <b>more consistent</b> even if the images and content change, increasing
              <b>memorability</b>.
            </li>
            <li>
              In the original website, it’s difficult to tell what the images in the
              gallery are and how to navigate the gallery. In the redesign, I added arrows
              to promote
              <b>more intuitive controls</b>. The arrows are added on top of the image to
              <b> minimize unnecessary white space </b>, especially for the mobile and
              tablet versions.
            </li>
            <li>
              I grouped together each location with its phone number and added a bit of
              extra whitespace in between each location to create a grid that encourages
              <b>better readability</b> and keeps this section distinct from other
              information. I also took out the bold styling in “Call Us to Order” in order
              to <b>prevent misinterpretations</b> of a clickable link.
            </li>
            <li>
              Here, the maps icon was taken out because it redirected people to one
              specific location. The icons were also changed to reflect a
              <b> more updated </b> and well-maintained interface. The Facebook and email
              sections were also moved here to <b>group similar elements</b> and
              <b>create a hierarchy</b> that emphasizes calling and ordering over emailing
              and social media.
            </li>
            <li>
              Finally, since I took out the “Reviews” section from the navigation bar, I
              combined it with the two commendations and awards that the shop wanted to
              display. This way, <b>similar information is grouped</b>, which also makes
              it easier to process.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h4>Hi-fi Prototyping</h4>
          <p>
            Next, I produced some hifi prototypes on Figma, one for large screens, one for
            tablet screens, and one for mobile screens.
          </p>
          <div class="img-container">
            <img src="assets/redesign/highfi.png" width="110%" class="img-thumbnail" />
          </div>
         
          <br />
          <h4>Visual Style Guide and Implementation</h4>
          <p>
            After constructing the hi-fi prototypes, I created the following style guide:
          </p>
          <div class="img-container">
            <img src="assets/redesign/visualGuide.png" width="60%" class="img-thumbnail" />
          </div>
          <br />
          <p>
            Then, using HTML/CSS and Bootstrap, I was able to successfully create the
            responsive website. You can
            <a href="https://sexyotter555.github.io/Responsive-Redesign/">check it out here!</a>
          </p>
          <div class="img-container">
            <img src="assets/redesign/resultpage.png" width="80%" class="img-thumbnail" />
          </div>
          <br />
          <h4>Conclusion</h4>
          <p>
            This project challenged my ability to identify design problems online and
            critically think about possible improvements. I gained a lot of valuable
            insight regarding the importance of accessibility and saw first-hand how much
            of the web isn't well-designed for everyone to use.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also gained more knowledge about the design process itself. While it was
            time consuming to analyze each element and go through the various different
            wireframes, those steps helped build a more thoughtful design. When actually
            implementing the website, I was really astonished by how much easier it was to
            use Bootstrap to make elements responsive and will definitely utilize it more
            in the future.
