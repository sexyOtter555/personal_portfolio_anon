            A store page for a hypothetical cafe selling corgi-themed coffee and refreshments. 
            The app supports filtering by dietary restrictions (dairy-free, nut-free, vegan), type
            (coffee, dessert, tea), and sorting by price. <br /><br>It can be viewed and
            interacted with <a href="https://sexyotter555.github.io/Development-anonymous/">here</a>.

          <h4>Introduction</h4>
          <p>
            For this project, we were to create a React app that uses a list interface
            that implements sorting and filtering. The Corgibucks Coffee Shop site serves as an order 
            site that allows customers to filter/sort on the available items and checkout. 
            The value of the application is that it provides an useful interface that allows users to order 
            food and drink online instead of having to wait in line in store. This project gave me a hands-on experience
            in making a webpage similar to most other online store and engage with its implementation and design process.

              width="100%"
              class="img-thumbnail"
            />
          </div>
          <br />
          <br />
          <h4>Goals and Research</h4>
          <p>
            The goal of this application is to simulate a real store's item catalog and
            shopping cart. Users should be able to browse the items by selecting certain
            filters and sorting by price, and then make a purchase by adding and removing
            items from their shopping cart. As such, I wanted to ensure that the interface
            was readable and easy to use and ended up looking at other online stores to
            see their browsing options.
          </p>
         
          <h4>Improvements and Additions</h4>
          <p>
            In my first iteration of this app, I had all the items displayed in one long
            list and the shopping cart only included the name of each item and its
            quantity. Since most online stores use a grid for easier browsing, I made each
            item and its description into a well ordered and consistent grid. I also ended
            up adding to the shopping cart in order to display more information about each
            item. Now, the shopping cart displays a mini image, the quantity, and the per
            unit price.
          </p>
          <h4>Conclusion</h4>
          <p>
            Something I took away from this project was being able to identify a specific
            goal and then create an app around that idea. While having an store with an
            online catalog and shopping cart isn't revolutionary, I think it's important
            to understand how similar concepts can be tailored towards more specific
            applications.
          </p>
          <p>
            While working on this project, I also became a lot more comfortable about
            working in React and thinking about component hierarchy. In this app, I stored
            a lot of information locally and didn't fully implement a checkout structure,
            but in the future, I'm excited to be able to tackle more complex and
            interactive web apps that will handle larger amounts of data.
